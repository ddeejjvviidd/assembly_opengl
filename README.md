# X86_64 Assembly with OpenGL

I was bored and wanted to discover how to use C functions in Assembly, so I did this stupid program which draws a line across the screen.

# Required

- nasm
- glfw library

```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
```

# How to run

```bash
make && make run
```

or

```bash
make && ./assgl.elf
```
